# Online Banking Platform UI

## Introduction

Welcome to our Online Banking Platform UI project! This project, created for INFO3130-23F-Sec1-The Emerging Interface under Dr. Tony Joseph, is a user interface (UI) design for an innovative online banking platform. Developed by Chiran Gurung, Mason Mathura, and Farid Fathi Seisan as Group #6, our UI design focuses on addressing key user needs and pain points identified through extensive user research.

## Project Overview

Our project delivers a user interface that caters to the evolving trends and requirements of digital banking users. We conducted thorough user research to understand the demographics, preferences, expectations, and pain points of potential users. Our findings indicate a significant digital banking trend among 25 to 34-year-olds in Canada, with a growing preference for mobile banking, especially among women.

## User Research

Our comprehensive user research focused on understanding the demographics, preferences, expectations, and pain points of potential users. We gathered insights into the rising trend of digital banking, especially among young adults and women in Canada, and integrated these findings into our design process.

## Key Findings:

- Demographics: Digital banking is popular among 25 to 34-year-olds, with an increasing trend in mobile banking usage.
- User Preferences: Features like easy-to-understand transactions, robust security, and personal financial assistance are highly valued.
- User Pain Points: Challenges such as inconsistent platform experiences and poor customer service were identified as major issues.

## UI Design

Our UI design addresses common issues in existing online banking applications, such as complex navigation and inadequate accessibility features. We have designed various pages, each tailored for both desktop and mobile view, ensuring a seamless user experience. These include:

- Sign-in Page
- Home Page
- Transaction Page
- Investment Page
- Transfer Funds Page
- Chat UI

## Accessibility Evaluation

We conducted a detailed accessibility evaluation and made necessary changes to ensure our design meets WCAG standards, particularly focusing on color contrast and navigation ease.

## Conclusion

Our project demonstrates a commitment to simplifying financial interactions and providing an inclusive and intuitive banking experience. It bridges key user research findings with practical UI solutions, resulting in a platform that resonates with users and enhances their digital banking journey.
